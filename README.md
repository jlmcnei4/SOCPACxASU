# SOCPACxASU
Special Operations Command Pacific (SOCPAC) is a sub-unified command of the US DoD for special operations forces in the United States and Indo-Pacific. Our project is a
comprehensive dashboard that houses data from a variety of military (active and reserve) institutions, as well as geopolitical, geographical, and foreign data. This data is very
intertwined, with many dependencies. The goal is for SOCPAC to be able to organize a team using the dashboard to conduct missions. The application will take into consideration
where the target is, which airport is closest, which crew can do the job with which plane, what clearances are required, and where the target needs to go. Ideally the dashboard
will also have information about weather in the target pick-up, and drop-off points. This will make missions by SOCPAC more efficient. Having a tool such as this dashboard is a
user friendly alternative to trying to make calls everywhere to organize groups of people and places. The timely manner that the dashboard will solve problems will allow safer and
faster missions, and save lives when time is crucial.
